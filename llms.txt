# ggsmc

Functions for plotting, and animating, the output of importance
samplers, sequential Monte Carlo samplers (SMC) and ensemble-based
methods. The package can be used to plot and animate histograms,
densities, scatter plots and time series, and to plot the genealogy of
an SMC or ensemble-based algorithm. These functions all rely on
algorithm output to be supplied in tidy format. A function is provided
to transform algorithm output from matrix format (one Monte Carlo point
per row) to the tidy format required by the plotting and animating
functions.

The package is available on CRAN and can be installed using:

    install.packages("ggsmc")

Examples of how to use the package can be found in [this
vignette](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/articles/Visualising.html).

# Package index

## All functions

- [`animate_density()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/animate_density.md)
  : An animated density of a single variable across targets.

- [`animate_histogram()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/animate_histogram.md)
  : An animated histogram of a single variable across targets.

- [`animate_reveal_time_series()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/animate_reveal_time_series.md)
  : Plot animated line graph showing parameter value vs dimension
  (revealed in the animation) from algorithm output.

- [`animate_scatter()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/animate_scatter.md)
  : A histogram of a single variable from a single target.

- [`animate_time_series()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/animate_time_series.md)
  : Plot animated line graph showing parameter value vs dimension across
  targets from algorithm output.

- [`cwna_data`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/cwna_data.md)
  : Data generated from a constant velocity (or continuous white noise
  acceleration, CWNA) model for 20 time steps.

- [`lv_output`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/lv_output.md)
  : 10000 simulations from a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model, assigned
  weights according to a Gaussian approximate Bayesian computation
  kernel with tolerance equal to 50.

- [`matrix2tidy()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/matrix2tidy.md)
  : Convert IS, SMC or EnK output stored as a matrix to tidy format.

- [`mixture_25_particles`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/mixture_25_particles.md)
  : The output of an SMC sampler where the initial distribution is a
  Gaussian and the final target is a mixture of Gaussians. 25 particles
  were used, with an adaptive method to determine the sequence of
  targets, and a Metropolis-Hastings move to move the particles at each
  step.

- [`plot_density()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/plot_density.md)
  : A density of a single variable.

- [`plot_genealogy()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/plot_genealogy.md)
  : Plot an SMC or EnK genealogy from algorithm output.

- [`plot_histogram()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/plot_histogram.md)
  : A histogram of a single variable.

- [`plot_scatter()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/plot_scatter.md)
  : A histogram of a single variable from a single target

- [`plot_time_series()`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/plot_time_series.md)
  : Plot line graph showing parameter value vs dimension from algorithm
  output.

- [`sir_cwna_model`](https://richardgeveritt.github.io/ggsmc/reference/sir_cwna_model.md)
  :

  The output of a bootstrap particle filter on the `cwna_data`. The
  output consists of 100 particles over 20 time steps.
