Description: Functions for plotting, and animating, the output of importance samplers, sequential Monte Carlo samplers (SMC) and ensemble-based methods. The package can be used to plot and animate histograms, densities, scatter plots and time series, and to plot the genealogy of an SMC or ensemble-based algorithm. These functions all rely on algorithm output to be supplied in tidy format. A function is provided to transform algorithm output from matrix format (one Monte Carlo point per row) to the tidy format required by the plotting and animating functions.
